# React-Todo-List

Observations and Learnings:

1. React Basics: Code demonstrates usage of React hooks (useState) to manage state within functional components. This approach is concise and aligns with modern React development practices.

2. Dynamic Filtering: Implemented dynamic filtering of todo items based on their completion status (currentFilter). This adds interactivity to your todo list, allowing users to focus on specific subsets of tasks.

3. User Interaction: Handled user interactions effectively, such as adding new todos, marking todos as completed, and removing todos. These functionalities cover essential aspects of a todo list application.

4. Simple Styling: The styling applied to the todo list is minimal yet sufficient for clarity. Keeping the UI simple makes the application easy to understand and use.

5. Readability: Code is well-structured and easy to follow. Each component and function has a clear purpose, enhancing readability and maintainability.

Overall, implementation effectively demonstrates fundamental concepts of React state management and user interaction while maintaining simplicity and clarity in code structure and styling.
